# Solidity Programming based Secure smart contracts on blockchain .

## Tools and framework used:
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/overview)
- [TruffleSuite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs)

#### Ganache allows you to create a private Ethereum blockchain for you to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates. It gives you the ability to perform all actions you would on the main chain without the cost. Many developers use this to test their smart contracts during development. It provides convenient tools such as advanced mining controls and a built-in block explorer.

#### Truffle is a developer environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains. It allows developers to spin up a smart contract project at the click of a button and provides you with a project structure, files, and directories that make deployment and testing much easier (or else you would have to configure these yourself).
